This is a Javascript Weather Dashboard.


It first asks the user to input a zip code and then returns the current temperature 
for that area from the Openweather API.

Then since it's in Kelvin, the option of converting the temperature to Farenheit and Celcius
is presented.  The inputted temerature will be returned in the desired standard after pushing 
the submit button. 

And Finally, upon hitting the graphing button, a temerature over time graph is produced, showing
intervals of three hours, over the course of several days.   The temperature is graphed in Kelvin.
